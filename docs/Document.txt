Research Software Engineering.
I have taken the dataset as, I found it interesting and it was short and firm and straight to the point. There weren’t much missing data available. 
It helped me to understand the overall hospital operations and hence, we can understand the dynamics better.
The data was already clean so there wasn’t much to do. 
Checked for relation between the dimensions available.

I have taken a dataset and have take 5 research questions where I will be visualizing the data for better understanding.
